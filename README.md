Frontend mentor QR code challenge
---
First take on this challenge from frontend mentor. My reason for taking this challenge was to test my knowledge on what I have learnt so far when it comes to Html and CSS. I will definitely come back to it to polish it.

Problems I encountered were,
- How to center the qr code's picture
- Correct units to use to size paragraph elements
- Proper alignment of text
- Centering main content

The first problem was kind of a drag because I had to center the image to fit into the main content. Had to try a lot of properties to figure out how to align it correctly, I think I did a decent job with it and it looks good.

Everything else was trial and error ðŸ˜…, really happy with my progress. Can't wait to try out more challenges and what I'm going to build next. Also need to work on commits and improve my CSS skills. This challenge sure has taught me a lot and it has also been an eye opening experience.
